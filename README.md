<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Wiktoria ♡ </h1>
<p align="left"> As a self-taught and passionate beginner programmer from Poland, I am happy to explore new areas of knowledge and work diligently to improve my skills, both in backend and frontend development. 
In collaboration with <b>@mil0sc</b> - privately my boyfriend and coding partner - we delve into coding, learning how to collaborate on software development, sharing knowledge and inspiration every day. <br>
My passions are music (including music programming), watching good cinema, reading books and art. <br>
I cherish working in my plant-filled apartment, where ideas blossom. ♡ </p>
